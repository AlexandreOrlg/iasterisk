# iAsterisk - The Ultra-Discreet Spellchecker powered by AI

![Built with](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Electron%20%7C%20Svelte%20%7C%20TailwindCSS-blueviolet)

Hey everyone, welcome to **iAsterisk**! 🪄 This is the spellchecker I always wanted: one that lets you fix your writing *without* anyone noticing—even in the middle of a video call!

### 🤔 Why I Built iAsterisk

I write constantly: emails, messages,sSpecification, posts… and, like everyone else, I make mistakes. I needed something quick, effective, and *super* discreet to correct my text. No bulky apps or obvious browser extensions. That’s when the idea for iAsterisk was born.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Discreet Correction**: iAsterisk works with your clipboard. With just two keyboard shortcuts, your text gets corrected and automatically replaces the original in your clipboard. It's optimized for quick, keyboard-only usage.
- **Customizable**: Use your own prompts for more accurate corrections or to change the tone of your text (business, casual—you decide).
- **Multi-Model AI Support**: Currently powered by OpenAI. Soon, you'll be able to choose between providers, with Anthropic and Ollama integration coming soon! 🎉
- **Multi-Language**: Works with any language. The interface is available in both French and English. 🌍

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

⚡ **New AI Models**: Anthropic and Ollama support are on the way for even more flexibility and power.

✍️ **Text Rewriting & Style Changes**: Next big step: allowing you to rewrite text and change styles. Need a formal email or a catchy LinkedIn post? This feature is coming soon!

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Copy your text.
2. Hit the iAsterisk keyboard shortcuts.
3. Your text is corrected and instantly replaces the content in your clipboard. That's it! 😉

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Electron**: For creating the cross-platform desktop application.
